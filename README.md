					Vehicle Management System


This application is developed using Spring Boot and ORM concepts managed by Spring Data JPA.

This Application is designed to manage the vehicles and its insurance by the transport authorities so that they can track the vehicles and insurance and update the details whenever required.
The authority can track the user by the vehicle plate number and check if there is any pending fine on the vehicle. Moreover, they can see if the vehicle has an active insurance and when is the insurance expiring.
